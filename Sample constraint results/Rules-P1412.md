    <td>http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P551(subject,v0) & http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P31(subject,Q5) => empty set</td>
    <td>Sensible</td>
    <td>Residence (P551) and instance of human (Q5) are unrelated. Humans (Q5) typically have a residence, so this rule is sensible for catching erroneous triples.</td>

    <td>Not Sensible</td>
    <td>"Influenced by" (P737) could easily relate to humans (Q5), particularly in cultural or intellectual contexts. This rule may flag valid triples, making it not sensible.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P26(subject,v0) & http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P31(subject,Q5) => empty set</td>
    <td>Not Sensible</td>

    <td>http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P108(subject,v0) & http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P31(subject,Q5) => empty set</td>
    <td>Sensible</td>
    <td>Employer (P108) and being a human (Q5) are unrelated in a direct way. This rule is sensible because it detects incorrect triples linking humans and employers.</td>

    <td>http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P136(subject,v0) & http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P31(subject,Q5) => empty set</td>
    <td>Sometimes Sensible</td>
    <td>Genre (P136) can be associated with humans, especially in creative fields. However, there are cases where this rule could catch errors. Sometimes sensible.</td>

    <td>http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P20(subject,v0) & http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P31(subject,Q5) => empty set</td>
    <td>Sensible</td>
    <td>Place of death (P20) and being a human (Q5) are unrelated in this ruleâ€™s context. This rule sensibly flags invalid triples.</td>

    <td>http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P106(subject,v0) & http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P31(subject,Q5) => empty set</td>
    <td>Sometimes Sensible</td>
    <td>Occupation (P106) is a valid relation for humans (Q5), but errors in occupation assignments can occur, making this rule sometimes sensible.</td>
