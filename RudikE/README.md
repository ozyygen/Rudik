# RuDiK

This repository contains a Java implementation of the extended version of RuDiK, a system for discovering positive and negative logical rules over RDF knowledge graphs. The prototype was first developed as a research project under the database group of Prof. Paolo Papotti at Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering, Arizona State University, and then  moved to the Data Science group of EURECOM.

To run Rudik, you can deploy the code in this repo, or use a Docker setup at https://github.com/ozyygen/rudik-docker 

If you are using Rudik, please consider citing one of the papers describing it.
